Document Graph
==============

**[Live demo](https://git.io/languages)**

This project shows a graph where the nodes are document formats and the
edges are converters. The graph is drawn using
[Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org), particularly the [CoSE layout
module](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js-cose-bilkent).


It is based on [@mohd-akram's Languages tool](https://github.com/mohd-akram/languages).
